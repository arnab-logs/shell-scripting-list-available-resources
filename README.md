# AWS Resource Lister – Shell Script for DevOps Beginners

Hey there!  
This is a companion script to my blog post where I documented my journey of writing a real-world shell script that interacts with AWS.

> **Goal:**  
> List active AWS resources (like EC2, S3, Lambda, etc.) for a given region and service — in a simple, beginner-friendly way.

This may look like a small script, but it reflects a common DevOps use case — scripts like this often run daily via cron to track infrastructure usage and cost.

---

## What This Script Does

- ✅ Accepts a region and service name as input  
- ✅ Validates the input and environment  
- ✅ Checks if AWS CLI is installed and configured  
- ✅ Lists live resources for supported AWS services  
- ✅ Provides clear and helpful messages for beginners  

---

## Supported AWS Services

You can use the script to list active resources for the following:

- `ec2` – EC2 Instances  
- `s3` – S3 Buckets  
- `rds` – RDS Databases  
- `dynamodb` – DynamoDB Tables  
- `iam` – IAM Users  
- `cloudformation` – Stacks  
- `vpc` – Virtual Private Clouds  
- `lambda` – Lambda Functions  
- `sns` – SNS Topics  
- `sqs` – SQS Queues  

---

## Example Usage

```bash
./aws_resource_list.sh us-east-1 ec2
./aws_resource_list.sh ap-south-1 s3
```

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure:

- ✅ AWS CLI is installed  
- ✅ You've configured your credentials using `aws configure`  
- ✅ You have the required permissions for the AWS services you're querying

## Script Overview

Here’s what the script checks for:

1. **Are two arguments passed?** (region & service)  
2. **Is AWS CLI installed?**  
3. **Is AWS CLI configured?** (i.e., `~/.aws` directory exists)  
4. **Is the service supported?** If yes → run the relevant AWS CLI command  

Each service has a specific command under the hood, like:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --region "$1"
aws s3 ls --region "$1"
aws rds describe-db-instances --region "$1"
```

---

## File Permissions

To make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x aws_resource_list.sh
```

For shared environments, you may also restrict read/edit access:

```bash
chmod 771 aws_resource_list.sh
```

This means:

- Owner and group can read, write, and execute  
- Others can only execute (no read/edit)  

---

## Why This Matters

This project is about more than just scripting.

It’s about:

- Moving from learning syntax → to building something real  
- Thinking about usability, validation, and reliability  
- Practicing DevOps habits — clarity, structure, and automation  

Even a small script like this can save hours, reduce confusion, and improve visibility into your cloud resources.
